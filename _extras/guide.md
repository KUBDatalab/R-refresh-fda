Why are we using the magrittr pipe ( %>% ) instead of the
base-R pipe (|>)?
As long as the default pipe-shortcut in RStudio (ctrl-alt-m) 
results int the magrittr pipe and not the base pipe, we are
using the magrittr pipe. The alternative would be to have 
all learners change the standard settings in RStudio.
